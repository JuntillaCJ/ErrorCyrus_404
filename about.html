  <p>Cyrus John Juntilla is an aspiring mathematician/software developer from the Philippines born in June 16, 2001. He started elementary school at around June 2008, Junior High School at around June 2014, Senior High School at around June 2018, and College at around August 2024. From grade 1 up to grade 10, he has competed in the annual Math Quiz Bee. During these 10 years, he had to train advanced mathematics. Per year, he trained for around a month or two in preparation for the quiz bees, giving him a strong mathematical and logical background.</p>
  <p>Grade 8 was his first dive into coding, where they had HTML subject at school. Unfortunately the tasks just involve copying the code the teacher posted. They however were not just Ctrl+C then Ctrl+V, they had to be typed, so with his strong logical background, he got a feel of how the syntax works in HTML and CSS.</p> 
  <p>The next dive into coding was in Grade 12, where he used excel during their quantitative research for the subject of Practical Research 2. Though this one is not really coding, its just data entry and basic analysis, but this gave him basic spreadsheet knowledge for the next chapter of his life.</p>
  <p>During the pandemic, various circumstances happened and he had to stop attending school for 2020-2023. However his curiosity for things he is passionate about didn't stop. While he was playing video games (Arknights, in particular), he encountered a resource management problem. The Arknights community probably already solved this problem, so he had no business in creating a very comprehensive spreadsheet with a couple of scripts for this. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RsD7xkLTJUUvIPcv6RSBIGJospUATD40c-kAZ1h5Efw/edit?usp=sharing">However he did</a> (under an online alias). The sheet layout is awful, and it absolutely makes no sense to people who haven't played Arknights, but this gave him mastery of spreadsheets and javascript fundamentals.</p>
  <p>For the rest of the pandemic up until 2023, while he wasn't attending school, he was self studying math, python, and Japanese language. Basically the things he is passionate about.</p>
  <p>2024 came and the situation for him got better, so he studied college at Unida Christian Colleges, where he took BS Computer Science. The language used is python. He is still learning some things about programming during this time, and was able to make a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AfjD93pgCj4z622G0edfGF38Jve9eBNz?usp=sharing">CLI Blackjack game</a> in python just before his second year in 2025. He is expected to graduate at 2028.</p>
